Coded by _[Karim K. Kanji](https://github.com/kanji-karanja)_

## What the program does
This program simply converts user input of numbers into English words of what they represent. 

>**Example:**<br>
>_input:_ 123 <br>
>_output:_ one hundred and twenty three

## Limitations
Currenty the program is limited to numbers less than 1000 but limited to positive numbers only.

## Future work:
Adding more to ensure it can convert any number from negative infinity to positive infinity.
